    "#### 2. What are the key features of Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is an interpreted language. That means that, unlike languages like C and its variants, Python does not need to be compiled before it is run. Other interpreted languages include PHP and Ruby.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is dynamically typed, this means that you don’t need to state the types of variables when you declare them or anything like that. You can do things like `x=111`and then `x=\"I'm a string\"` without error\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is well suited to object orientated programming in that it allows the definition of classes along with composition and inheritance. Python does not have access specifiers (like C++’s `public`, `private`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, functions are first-class objects. This means that they can be assigned to variables, returned from other functions and passed into functions. Classes are also first class objects\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing Python code is quick but running it is often slower than compiled languages. Fortunately，Python allows the inclusion of C based extensions so bottlenecks can be optimized away and often are. The numpy package is a good example of this, it’s really quite quick because a lot of the number crunching it does isn’t actually done by Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python finds use in many spheres – web applications, automation, scientific modeling, big data applications and many more. It’s also often used as “glue” code to get other languages and components to play nice."

    "2. The allocation of heap space for Python objects is done by Python’s memory manager. The core API gives access to some tools for the programmer to code.\n",
